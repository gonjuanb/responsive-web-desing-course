            <p>Here's a time line of Christopher Nolan:</p>

                <li><b>1993</b> - After earning his bachelor's degree, he worked as a script reader, camera operator and

                <li><b>2000</b> - Filmed Memento the breakthrough of his career</li>
                <li><b>2003</b> - Nolan approached Warner Bros. with the idea of making a new Batman film, based on the
                    character's origin story.He was fascinated by the notion of grounding it in a more realistic world

            </ul>
            <p>"Christopher Nolan doesn't make sense. And that is exactly how he likes it. In twenty-three years and
                through twelve films, he has defied the laws of Hollywood by creating startling, original genre pieces
                that have revelled in their own complexity, confounding every maxim by which the studios hope to appeal
                to the widest audience. And yet he does that too. Cinemas fill on the possibility of the next Nolan
                film. Whatever form it might take." â€”Film author Ian Nathan on Nolan as a filmmaker (2022)</p>
